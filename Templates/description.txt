In order to create an email using a template to send to our students, we need to first specify what data we require from
the front-end team. The web developers will implement a form on different pages to collect relevant information (for
example, the email address of a student we want to email, the grade they got, etc.) and pass in this data to us using a
text file (.txt). 

The first useful element of this text file (let's call it InputTextFile.txt) is an integer which represents
the type of message we should send (notifying student of their grade, reminding them when an assignment is due, etc.). At
this point, the Runner class' main method will make a decision on which template file to use as a reference when checking
if the rest of the information in InputTextFile.txt is valid. For example, let's say I want to notify a student of their grade
once it has been corrected, I will pass in a '0' as the first element of InputTextFile.txt and then I have to say what the
student's email was in the next element and then what the grade was. Whereas if I wanted to remind a student of an assignment
deadline, this requires a completely different set of information. The templates indicate what information is required for
each different type of message we want to send. Main looks at the first integer and then validates the rest of the information
we pass in with InputTextFile.txt based on the template for that command.

Design: '0' = Grade notification  '1' = Missing assignment  '2' = Event/class reminder

<Insert IF CODE SNIPPET>

More commands can be added to this list though it is not programmatically efficient to write another 'if' statement every time. 
I could have used dynamic allocation to have an ArrayList of commands, each of which can be accessed using an index rather than 
having a long list of 'if' statements. Since for this specific project, we only need a few commands, it was simpler to hardcode
these commands in.



See FileInputFormat.txt for complete decription of how input data should be formatted as files into our program.
